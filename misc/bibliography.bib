    abstract = {The last decade has yielded dramatic and quite surprising breakthroughs in natural
          language processing through the use of simple artificial neural network computations,
          replicated on a very large scale and trained over exceedingly large amounts of data. The
          resulting pretrained language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, have provided a powerful
          universal language understanding and generation base, which can easily be adapted to many
          understanding, writing, and reasoning tasks. These models show the first inklings of a
          more general form of artificial intelligence, which may lead to powerful foundation models
          in domains of sensory experience beyond just language.},
