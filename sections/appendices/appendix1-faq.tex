\section{Getting Feedback}
\label{app:feedback}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Get feedback \textbf{often} and from different audiences â€“ your family,
	      friends, professors, colleagues, advisor, other graduate students. The more you
	      talk about your research, the more comfortable you get with it.
	\item Keep a positive attitude. Research is hard. If it were easy, everyone would be
	      doing it.
	\item Consider setting up or joining a thesis group to share your ideas and
	      experiences.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Supervisor's feedback}\\
Some supervisors will ask for you to send each chapter as you complete it, offering feedback at that point, and then again at the end when the thesis chapters are collated. Other supervisors may want to be more involved, and there are others who will not want to see your thesis until it is completed by your standards. Whichever approach your supervisor takes, be aware that they will need some time to read through your work and provide feedback. Your thesis review is likely not the only piece of work your supervisor is undertaking, so be patient and factor review time into your work schedule.

A couple of points to note about supervisor feedback:
\begin{itemize}
	\item You will receive feedback on your approach to research (i.e., method,
	      experiment design etc...) as well as your writing. It is your responsibility to
	      take notes at meetings etc. in order to record this feedback. It is also up to
	      you whether or not you act upon the feedback provided.
	\item Your supervisor's role is to guide your work. It is not their job to complete
	      the research, suggest methods, design experiments, or to write/rewrite sections
	      of your thesis.
	\item Your supervisor should be supportive but sometimes their feedback may be
	      difficult to hear. Just remember, their goal is to guide you and to make you a
	      better researcher. Learn to have your work criticised in a constructive manner,
	      it is part of the learning process.
	\item It is not the role of your supervisor to proofread your thesis. Many
	      supervisors will point out typos, grammatical errors or styling issues etc.
	      when they see them, but this is not their role.
\end{itemize}

\section{Proofreading/copyediting} \label{app:proofreading}
It is important to have your work proofread\footnote{Two types of editing that
	are commonly used interchangeably are copy editing and proofreading. Both types
	of editing clean up writing, but each has its distinct contribution to the
	process.
	\url{https://thesiswhisperer.com/2016/11/30/doing-a-copy-edit-of-your-thesis/}}.
If English is not your first language, this is even more important for you.

\textbf{How?}\\
A good approach is to proofread yourself as you write and then again when you are finished writing a section or chapter. When you have a near final draft, have it proofread by a friend, family member, colleague, or a classmate etc... (not your supervisor). Choose your proofreader wisely. Make sure that they have good written English skills and are able to spot grammatical errors. A native English speaker can be good for this but not all native English speakers have the skills needed to be a good proofreader.

There are many things to look out for when reviewing your own work, everything
from text alignment and section numbering, to figures and tables, to spelling
and grammar. It's best to identify and fix any of these errors immediately.
Don't wait until the end because these will build up and it often takes longer
than you think to fix them.

If you find that you make the same mistake regularly, e.g., you misspell the
same word regularly, or you use a colon where you shouldn't, then make a list
of these to check back when you are finished each section (the search feature
is good for this).

\section{Writing Assistants} \label{App:writing_assist}
In the past, students may have used tools such as Grammarly or Quetext, but
this has become more problematic because such editing tools now come with AI
assisted writing (see more here:
\url{https://tudublin.libguides.com/c.php?g=720901&p=5233062}).

Using tools such as a spell checker, a grammar checker, and a punctuation
checker are generally acceptable. Using more advanced tools to rewrite
sentences, check tone, offer alternative word choices, offer citations etc...
is not acceptable.

If in doubt don't use any such software. In general, it appears that, as of
2025, the free version of Grammarly is fine to use, but the pro version is not.
