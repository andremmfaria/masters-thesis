\chapter{Discussion of Results}\label{sec:Results}

\section{Section Introduction}

The reporting and discussion thesis chapters deal with the central part of the
thesis. This is where you present the data that forms the basis of your
investigation, shaped by the way you have interpreted it and developed your
argument or theories about it. In other words, you tell your readers the
research story that has emerged from your findings. These chapters will form
the bulk of your complete thesis. Before you even begin writing up the
reporting and discussion chapters, youâ€™ll need to undertake some thinking and
planning.

There is quite a loot to say about this topic so Ive provided a like here for
